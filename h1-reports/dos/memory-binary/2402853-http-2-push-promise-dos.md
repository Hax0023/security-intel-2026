## Summary
A logic error in the `discard_newhandle` function causes a negation operator to prevent proper cleanup of HTTP/2 PUSH_PROMISE stream data. When a malformed PUSH_PROMISE frame with an invalid `:scheme` pseudo-header is received, the cleanup code is never executed, resulting in a memory leak that can be exploited to exhaust available memory.

## Attack scenario
1. Attacker establishes HTTP/2 connection to vulnerable curl client
2. Attacker sends crafted PUSH_PROMISE frames with invalid `:scheme` pseudo-headers
3. curl receives PUSH_PROMISE and attempts to process it via `push_promise` function
4. `set_transfer_url` validates the `:scheme` header and returns an error
5. Error triggers call to `discard_newhandle` to clean up resources
6. Due to negation logic bug, `http2_data_done` is never called, leaving allocated memory unreleased
7. Repeated malformed PUSH_PROMISE frames exhaust heap memory, causing DoS

## Root cause
Inverted logic in `discard_newhandle` function: `if(!newhandle->req.p.http)` should be `if(newhandle->req.p.http)`. The negation operator prevents the cleanup function from executing when HTTP protocol data exists, leaving allocated structures from `http2_data_setup` in memory.

## Attacker mindset
An attacker would recognize that HTTP/2 servers can initiate PUSH_PROMISE frames to clients, and that validation errors in frame processing present opportunities for resource exhaustion. By crafting frames that trigger errors but skip cleanup routines, they can force cumulative memory leaks with minimal bandwidth overhead.

## Defensive takeaways
- Implement strict code review processes for resource cleanup paths and error handling routines
- Use automated static analysis tools to detect unreachable cleanup code and resource leaks
- Apply comprehensive unit and integration testing for error conditions, especially in protocol handlers
- Implement resource limits and accounting to detect abnormal memory consumption patterns
- Consider fuzzing HTTP/2 frame processing with malformed headers to identify similar issues
- Use memory sanitizers (ASan, Valgrind) in CI/CD pipelines to catch leaks before release
- Implement rate limiting on PUSH_PROMISE frames from remote peers

## Variant hunting
Search for other inverted conditional logic in resource cleanup paths across codebase
Audit all error paths in HTTP/2 stream creation (`h2_duphandle`, `push_promise`) for incomplete cleanup
Examine similar cleanup functions in HTTP/1.x and other protocol handlers for identical patterns
Review all locations where `http2_data_done` should be called but may be skipped
Analyze other pseudo-header validation functions that could trigger early errors with incomplete cleanup
Check for similar negation bugs in connection filter cleanup routines

## MITRE ATT&CK
- T1190
- T1499

## Notes
The vulnerability demonstrates how subtle logic errors in conditional statements can completely bypass security-critical cleanup code. The bug was in curl's HTTP/2 connection filter and was particularly dangerous because PUSH_PROMISE frame handling is automatic and initiated by remote servers, making it difficult for clients to defend against. The fix requires simply removing the negation operator. The valgrind output shows 200 blocks of 352 bytes each (70,400 total) leaked from `http2_data_setup` allocations, confirming the resource leak thesis.

## Full report

## Summary:
In `discard_newhandle` the condition in the `if` statement is always `false` for http transfer due to a negation.
As a result `http2_data_done` will never be called.
```
static void discard_newhandle(struct Curl_cfilter *cf,
                              struct Curl_easy *newhandle)
{
  if(!newhandle->req.p.http) {
    http2_data_done(cf, newhandle, TRUE);
    newhandle->req.p.http = NULL;
  }
  (void)Curl_close(&newhandle);
}
```

`discard_newhandle` is supposed to close stream and free resources allocated in `http2_data_setup` 
as well as close `Curl_easy` handle when some error occurs in `push_promise`.
For example if `PUSH_PROMISE` frame has invailid `:scheme` pseudo header `set_transfer_url` in `push_promise` will return an error.
```
    rv = set_transfer_url(newhandle, &heads);
    if(rv) {
      discard_newhandle(cf, newhandle);
      rv = CURL_PUSH_DENY;
      goto fail;
    }
```
An attacker could send specially crafted `PUSH_PROMISE` frames to trigger the error.
This would result in a memory leak for every malformed frame received, consequently using all available memory. 



## Steps To Reproduce:

  1. compile `nghttp2` with {F3099706} applied
  1. compile {F3099707}
  1. run `nghttpd -p/=/foo.bar --no-tls 8181`
  1. run `valgrind --leak-check=full ./http2_push_headers`

for each `-p` option `nghttpd` will send 200 `PUSH_PROMISE` frames with invalid `:scheme` header
